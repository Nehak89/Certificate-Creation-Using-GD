# Certificate-Creation-Using-GD
Here I have created a dynamic certificate in PHP using PHP GD Library.
In this project I created a attractive form using html.
This form is for taking input from user to create a certificate.
In this form ,I have considered some input fields as student name,grade as input from user.
After submitting this form the certificate will be created dynamically.
